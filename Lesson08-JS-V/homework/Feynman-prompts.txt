* `prototype`: this allows you to create and customize functions for use on multiple objects.
    You set up a general method (function) with prototype and then you can access that function
    as many times as you need to, rather than re-writing the method for every object you create.
	
* Constructors: these are also called classes, and they allow you to set up templates or
    blueprints to handle multiple instances/copies.
