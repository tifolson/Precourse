Arrays: pieces of data that you store all together, kind of like a list. The pieces are separate but related
    in some way. For example, you might have several appointments with different people. You can put all of 
    the peoples' names into one list/line of code, rather than listing them all separately. This helps you to 
    not repeat yourself.
