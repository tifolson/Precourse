Variables: something you want to store and use later

Strings: pieces of text that you put in quotation marks; can be words or sentences or phrases

Functions (arguments, `return`): 
    some goal you want to accomplish with data that requires an argument (input) 
    that gives you a return (output)

`if` statements: 
    setting up a conditional situation with rules so that 'if' something happens, that causes 
    something else to follow

Boolean values (`true`, `false`):
    true = yes or 1
    false = no or 0
