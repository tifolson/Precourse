Callback functions: these are functions within functions; it's like having a set of instructions that you write once,
and then you are able to refer to those instructions again later if you need to. You can store the set of
instructions in a variable and then if you need those instructions again, all you need to do is write that variable
name, rather than having to re-write the list of instructions over and over again. Basically, you can avoid
repeating yourself.
